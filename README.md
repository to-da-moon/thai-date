#Acknowledgements
This library is free software based on dayjs. We just make it simple for thailand format display.

## Getting Started

This library consists of 2 functions thaiDate and thaiTime 

## Example Usage

thaiDate(new Date()) // return date in date year in Buddha year  e.g.  2021-10-04  -----> 04/10/2564

thaiDate(new Date()) // return thai time  e.g.  Thu, 07 Oct 2021 11:00:00 GMT  ----->  18:00

#Future Plan
We will make more simple case for thai people formating which will include the date in thai language
